# A brief introduction to Secure-PI
Secure-PI is a raspberry pi based project powered by google TensorFlow, in other words, a security camera with human recognition based on AI detection.
The way it works is that it takes pictures whenever human presence is detected in the camera's field of view. All the pictures have a timestamp and can be found on the web interface giving the user the ability to remotely see what is happening. Besides that, it also features a live view and an SMTP server which serves to send e-mails to the users if the IP address has changed, due to the fact that most ISP uses DHCP to randomly allocate the IP addresses and some of them change the IP's quite often, this way we provide a stable connection to the camera.
